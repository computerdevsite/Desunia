            <h2>AUTOBIOGRAPHY LETTER</h2>
            <p>Fatima Bustamante Desunia was born and raised in Osiao Bacon District Sorsogon City, She spent much of her childhood surrounded by her family and friends. Looking back on her life, she realize that the experiences and challenges she have faced have shaped into the person today. Writing her autobiography gives her a chance to reflect on my journey, the people who have influenced her, and the lessons she learned along the way. she was born on August 29 20001 to Jenny Natad Bustamante Desunia and Nilo Docdocos Desunia. Growing up, her family was always her greatest support system. They instilled in to her the importance of education, kindness, and hard work. her mother is a plain house wife and her father is a farmer, worked tirelessly to provide for our family and encouraged her to pursue her dreams. they are 6 siblings in our family she have 2 borthers and 4 girls, and they are all close growing up. her home was filled with laughter, games, and shared memories, but like most families, they also had an struggles. she remember a particularly tough time when her family faced financial difficulties. While it was hard, it taught the value of perseverance, and she learned how to appreciate the little things in life, like family moments, which she often took for granted before. In school, there was always an inquisitive student, eager to learn.However, school wasn't always easy for her. As a child, she was often shy and struggled with socializing, which sometimes made her feel isolated.Despite these challenges, she found a way to excel in her studies. she was often the quiet student in the back of the classroom, but I enjoyed the peace of working through problems on her own.It was during these years that she began to realize that her academic strengths would be key to building a successful future. High school was a turning point in my life. I became involved in extracurricular activities, including SSG officer, intrams runner,Youth Organization,Yes-O club and volunteer work, which allowed me to develop confidence and leadership skills. I took on roles that pushed me out of my comfort zone, like vice president of yes-o club , and auditor in SSG officer, and these experiences taught me how to work with others, communicate effectively, and deal with setbacks. After high school, she made the decision to stop schooling and after a year and get a work she also make a decidion to pursuing my goal. Now she was currently a second-year student at Sorsogon College of Criminology, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Criminology. Balancing my education with a job has been a challenging yet fulfilling experience. As a working student, she have learned not only the academic principles of criminology but also valuable life skills such as time management, perseverance, and responsibility. This autobiography is a reflection on my experiences so far, the obstacles they faced, and the lessons they learned. Coming from a modest background, she always understood the value of hard work.her family has always been supportive of her educational goals, but the financial burden of college tuition and living expenses was something she couldn’t ignore. As a result, she decided to take on a part-time job while pursuing her degree. The idea of being a working student was both exciting and intimidating. she knew that balancing work and school would require discipline, but she was determined to make it work. she started her college journey at Sorsogon College of Criminology with a sense of purpose. Ever since she was young, she been fascinated by law enforcement and the justice system. The idea of becoming a criminologist or a police officer motivated her to pursue this course, but the practical reality of funding her education meant that she had to juggle her studies with a job. The job also helped her develop her communication. In her first year, she quickly realized how difficult it would be to balance both work and school. she had to adapt to a new academic environment at Sorsogon College of Criminology, with courses like Introduction to Criminology, Criminal Law, and Police Administration. While she was deeply interested in these subjects, she also had to manage a work schedule that often left her with limited time to study. she found her self staying up late to finish assignments or waking up early to prepare for exams. It was exhausting at times, but she knew that she had to keep pushing forward. One of the biggest challenges she faced was learning how to manage here time effectively. At first, she struggled to find a balance between her responsibilities at work and her academic commitments. There were days when she would feel overwhelmed, and the pressure of having to perform well in both areas would weigh heavily on her. However, she soon learned the importance of prioritization. she started organizing her schedule by setting clear goals for the day and making sure she stayed focused on completing the most important tasks first. Additionally, she had to be mindful of her physical and mental health. Long shifts at work combined with a full course load sometimes left her feeling burnt out. she learned that it’s okay to ask for help when needed—whether that’s seeking academic assistance from talking to friends or family, or even taking breaks to recharge. Through these experiences, she developed a better understanding of her own limits and how to navigate the demands of being a working student. Despite the challenges, her time at Sorsogon College of Criminology has been incredibly rewarding. As she progressed into her second and third years, she became more confident in her academic abilities and her passion for criminology. Courses like Criminal Investigation, Forensic Science, and Criminal Psychology piqued here interest even more. These subjects provided her with a deeper understanding of criminal behavior and the justice system, which only fueled her desire to pursue a career in law enforcement. As a working student, she have learned many valuable life lessons. The most important of these is the need for resilience. There have been times when she wanted to give up, when the stress from work and school felt like too much to handle. But each time, she reminded myself of why she started this journey in the first place: to achieve here dreams and make a positive impact in the field of criminology. These moments of self-reflection have made me stronger and more determined. Another lesson she learned the value of discipline. Being a working student requires a high level of self-discipline. she had to develop habits such as setting a strict study schedule, avoiding procrastination, and making sure she manage here finances wisely. These habits, though difficult to cultivate, have helped here not only succeed in school but also grow as a person. Being a working student has been a journey of growth, challenges, and perseverance. Balancing work and school has not been easy, but it has taught here valuable lessons in time management, resilience, and discipline.</p>
